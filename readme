This is a light weight stock trading simulation. 
It is light weight sicne this time I did not use database, 
instead I used a simple CSV file to store user data and stcok data.

You are able to buy,sell, deposit, check portfolio. Once one buys stock, 
it updates the share count both on the market side and user side. 
Once there is a transaction, either sell or buy, 
the market adjusts itself and raises or decreases in price. 

THe purpose of this project was to pracitice backend OOP development with Java.
